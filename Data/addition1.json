Now I should begin by saying I actually had quick a fantastic night here. Won a jackpot on the slots and had a really fun time for a few hours after and walked out absolutely even. I am removing the two stars for a couple of reasons. The first star The Hard Rock lost is due to our dealer on a blackjack table. The poor gentleman was quite friendly but clearly struggling when it came to counting cards. Now I\u2019m all for equal opportunity however being able to do simple addition seems like a fairly important job requirement for a casino dealer. The second star that I have removed is due to the extremely poor attitude of a drink server. She was either just having a rough night or something else might have been wrong but her attitude was really not very appropriate especially after even giving her a couple dollars for a coke as a tip. In a casino I would expect that the service should be on point. Especially when people are literally giving thousands to the establishment.

This outdoor  venue is in a beautiful treed setting overlooking a small lake. The lawn is beautifully maintained and always green even during the dry spells. KIDS: Children 10 years and under are free to attend with a supervising adult which gives it a nice family feel. Drinkers and kids are notoriously absent minded and you'll want to pay attention that partiers don't spill beer on your kids. Even in summer, the grass gets damp in the evening... bring something to sit on.\nGETTING THERE: The park easily accessible by car, public transit and close to the freeway. There's plenty of free parking at the school for weekend and evening events and it's only a couple of blocks away from the venue. Traffic is usually managed effectively by the local police.\nSMOKING: even though this area is deemed as non-smoking, you will find plenty of people lined up in certain areas smoking cigarettes and throughout the entire venue smoking a lot of marijuana. It's best to sit on the west side of the lawn (right side facing the stage) because the wind usually blows eastward and this will protect you from getting out too much smoke in your face.\nWASHROOMS: Lots and lots of portable units specifically designated male and female. Normally I don't care whether I have a gender-specific washroom, but when there's a lot of drinking and low light I do appreciate the effort to keep us girls clean.\nDRINKING WATER: There's only one drinking station and it's at the back on the right hand (west) side near the washrooms. You may bring an empty water bottle.\nFOOD:  There is a limited selection of the usual event type food (and prices) for sale and lineups can be long. No outside food is permitted. I recommend eating at home beforehand. If you accidentally bring food, you can easily eat it outside the venue before you come in still listen to the music while you wait.\nBERR: Yes there's beer! In plastic cups with a limit of two per person per purchase. So you can go back and get more if you can afford it.","time":1602875375}],"user_ratings_total":4668},"17":{"name":"H.R.
