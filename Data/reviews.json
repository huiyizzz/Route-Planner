The instructors are all world class and make an effort to get to know each person's names and connect with them. Overall, I was blown away by the experience and absolutely love the culture and energy the team at All City bring day in and day out.","time":1598555929}],"user_ratings_total":295},"13956":{"name":"0238 Thornton & 1st"},"14027":{"name":"Creekside Park","rating":4.5,"reviews":[{"author_name":"big shmoe","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/108154237362541822106\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GgsW4rZW5B8N0gtcHqHLDXNjzZmUk1fA75yvdIkiA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"I didn't spend much time there...","time":1598731913},{"author_name":"Arnold Nowicki","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/102219368811139492056\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14Gg5aiVKskrQ0gUET5-_Ad253Li3WE2K9yPib7sO=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Great ocean (inlet) view.

They get a 4.5. I originally called the Oakridge store about 18 k earrings out of stock online.  They found 1 stud at Park Royal and another at the downtown Vancouver store.  Over the phone, they helped me special-transfer ordered them to Oakridge. This was five star service. They lost marks for not telling explicitly telling me how the pouch worked (I thought I lost an earring) and for not telling me how to tighten the butterfly backing (I lost a backing on day 5). Maybe it's common knowledge...I have no clue since I haven't worn earrings in 20+ years due to ear lobe infections.\n\nDue to COVID hour changes, I couldn't call in for help until day 7. Oakridge said they would've replaced for free but they had no stock since they were in the process of closing (Oakridge area rejuvenation project). Park Royal said they do not have any replacements and would charge to order one.  Dwntown Vancouver said that if they had a replacement in store they would replace for free or special order one for a fee.\n\nAfter a 40 min trip...\n\n1. A Birk representative opened the door in and out, so I didn't have to touch the handles\n\n2. Inside it was spacious, bright, and clean.\n\n3. The Birk representative inside was super friendly and helpful.  He found the replacement and taught me how to tighten the butterfly backing.\n\n4.  He showed me another variety of earrings and there was no sales pressure.\n\nThe downtown location gets 5 stars. Wonderful service considering I didn't buy from their location.\n\nI'm so glad I went with Birks.  It was really hard finding a store I trusted that carried quality 18k earrings. I'm also glad I didn't go with an online only store.\n\nI am already eyeing their pearls and Muse earrings. Will come back to this location whenever possible.\n\nHappy customer.","time":1600812503}],"user_ratings_total":52},"15115":{"name":"East 10th Avenue & Kingsway"},"15723":null,"15891":null,"15970":{"name":"Lion Clock","rating":4.5,"reviews":[{"author_name":"JB JB","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/100873294229536788736\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GitomvjYAJOta_70YqgVaLu5VF_-Wwhm8hDNe1G=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba8","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"2 years ago","text":"The Lion Clock was donated by the Hong Kong expatriate community Lions Club to the city of Vancouver.","time":1533199788},{"author_name":"Dave McMillan","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/101996637077154027251\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GjsMhXhQbBvfF4seTAXazh5-4GKBHdE6317FhTAOA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"It a clock","time":1560064324}],"user_ratings_total":2},"16065":null,"16136":{"name":"4 Cats Arts Academy"},"16371":{"name":"Herman Ott\u00f3 K\u00f6rnyezetv\u00e9delmi \u00e9s Mez\u0151gazdas\u00e1gi Szakgimn\u00e1zium, Szakk\u00f6z\u00e9piskola \u00e9s Koll\u00e9gium","rating":3.5,"reviews":[{"author_name":"Zolt\u00e1n B\u00fcki","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/109837273065415231605\/reviews","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GgwXP5pGcuTtDMXJaofYRHgu5N0RzK4JGb0_WQTmQU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"","time":1557471412},{"author_name":"Varga K\u00e1roly","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/113697829537898277729\/reviews","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GimxFFVUFhW7XQLozfkua0NRGQzWnxvAg7NHvAHrQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"10 months ago","text":"","time":1580136933},{"author_name":"kok\u00fasz14","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/101806849891251745859\/reviews","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GjMOaSioUBOwHMWzOsVcSLZIW15kbwk3OfxJ9tb=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"","time":1566463686},{"author_name":"Edit Kov\u00e1cs","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/115021994931655334614\/reviews","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/-BbjaiQ7v_cE\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/AMZuuckBf63kQ2FH47K9zF56QClfqaFeoA\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo\/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"","time":1567179654},{"author_name":"Zolt\u00e1n Moln\u00e1r","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/116828635602327191031\/reviews","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/-BG8k4Ycz978\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/AMZuucnWuyYBAj2N1mc7iL5UxnH3-6QVWA\/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5\/photo.jpg","rating":3,"relative_time_description":"a year ago","text":"","time":1570966226}],"user_ratings_total":8},"16372":{"name":"Hfour Design Studio","rating":5,"reviews":[{"author_name":"Daish Malani","author_url":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/105663942830620391067\/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GgiA72x7GUYPsTJbP4_RIEim0yyRvmHSqE6TqdH0w=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 years ago","text":"Every now and then everyone has a fleeting idea of something great, amazing that they might do.. and then don't do it.
